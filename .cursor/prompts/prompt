I need you to build a complete Enterprise Content Marketing Crew application using the AAMAD methodology. 
This is a multi-phase development project that requires careful planning and execution.

IMPORTANT: Please follow the AAMAD development rules in @aamad-core, @development-workflow, and @crewai-patterns for this project.

## Context Understanding Phase
First, thoroughly analyze these context documents in this order:
1. project-context/market-research-report.md - Understand market opportunity and user needs
2. project-context/product-requirements-doc.md - Extract exact agent specifications and requirements
3. project-context/system-architecture-doc.md - Understand technical architecture and MVP scope

## Development Execution Plan

### Phase A: Planning & Architecture (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)
1. **Create comprehensive development plan** based on all context documents
2. **Write detailed plan** to docs/development-plan.md including:
   - Project overview and objectives
   - Technical architecture summary
   - Agent specifications (exact roles, goals, backstories from PRD)
   - Development phases with deliverables
   - Testing strategy for each phase
   - Success criteria and validation steps
   - File structure and organization
   - Dependencies and technology choices
3. **Validate plan** against all requirements from context documents

### Phase B: Environment Setup
1. **Initialize Next.js 14 project** with TypeScript and App Router
2. **Install all necessary dependencies**:
   - Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
   - assistant-ui for LLM interface
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Prisma for database management
   - Required AI SDK packages
   - Development tools (ESLint, Prettier)
3. **Configure development environment**:
   - Environment variables template
   - Database setup (SQLite for MVP)
   - Build and development scripts
4. **Create project structure** following the development plan

### Phase C: CrewAI Backend Implementation
1. **Implement CrewAI agents** exactly as specified in the PRD:
   - Research Agent with proper tools and memory configuration
   - Content Strategist Agent with strategic capabilities
   - Content Planner Agent with planning and distribution tools
2. **Create task orchestration** with sequential processing
3. **Implement crew configuration** with proper collaboration patterns
4. **Add custom tools** for content marketing workflows
5. **Create Python service layer** for agent management
6. **Test agent functionality** independently

### Phase D: Next.js Frontend with assistant-ui
1. **Set up assistant-ui integration** with proper providers
2. **Create main chat interface** for user interactions
3. **Implement custom tool components** for displaying agent results:
   - Research insights display component
   - Content strategy visualization
   - Content planning interface
4. **Add feedback collection** mechanisms
5. **Implement responsive design** with Tailwind CSS

### Phase E: API Integration Layer
1. **Create Next.js API routes** connecting frontend to CrewAI
2. **Implement streaming responses** for real-time updates
3. **Add proper error handling** and validation
4. **Create database models** for conversation history
5. **Implement basic authentication** (if required)

### Phase F: Testing & Validation
1. **Unit tests** for core agent functionality
2. **Integration tests** for complete workflow
3. **End-to-end testing** of user experience
4. **Performance testing** to meet <30 second response time requirement
5. **User feedback testing** with sample content marketing scenarios

### Phase G: Local Development Setup
1. **Configure development server** with proper environment
2. **Set up database** with initial schema
3. **Test complete workflow** end-to-end
4. **Create development documentation**
5. **Launch application locally** and validate all functionality

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Requirements:
- **TypeScript everywhere** with proper type definitions
- **Error boundaries** and graceful error handling
- **Consistent code style** following Next.js and CrewAI best practices
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging agent interactions
- **Performance optimization** for agent response times

### Validation Checkpoints:
- After each phase, test functionality before proceeding
- Ensure all requirements from PRD are implemented
- Validate agent collaboration matches architecture specifications
- Confirm MVP scope boundaries are respected

### Success Criteria:
- Working Enterprise Content Marketing Crew application
- All three agents (Research, Strategist, Planner) functioning correctly
- assistant-ui interface providing smooth user experience
- Complete content marketing workflow operational
- Application launches successfully on localhost
- Basic feedback collection and analytics working

## Final Deliverable:
A fully functional MVP application that demonstrates the complete AAMAD methodology from research-driven planning to working multi-agent system, ready for Phase 3 MVP deployment.

Execute this plan systematically, creating the development-plan.md file first, then proceeding through each phase with proper validation at each step. Ask for clarification if any requirements from the context documents are unclear.

CRITICAL: Ensure you're following all AAMAD methodology principles and CrewAI patterns defined in the referenced rules throughout development.
