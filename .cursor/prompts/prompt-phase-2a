I need you to prepare the development environment for an Enterprise Content Marketing Crew application following AAMAD methodology. This includes complete environment variable setup.

## Environment Setup Tasks:

1. **Create .env.example file** with all required variables:
   - OPENAI_API_KEY (for CrewAI agents)
   - SERPER_API_KEY (for web search tools)
   - DATABASE_URL (for Prisma/SQLite)
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL (for frontend)
   - NODE_ENV (development/production)
   - Any other API keys needed per the system architecture

2. **Create .env file** with placeholder values and clear instructions:
   - Copy from .env.example
   - Add comments explaining where to get each API key
   - Include links to API provider signup pages
   - Add validation notes for each key format

3. **Configure environment loading**:
   - Next.js environment variable configuration
   - Prisma .env integration
   - CrewAI environment variable loading
   - Type-safe environment variable validation

4. **Add .cursorignore entries**:
   - Prevent .env file from being included in AI context
   - Add .env.local, .env.production to ignore list
   - Protect sensitive configuration files

5. **Initialize Next.js 14 project** with TypeScript and App Router
6. **Install all dependencies** from system architecture requirements
7. **Create CrewAI project structure** with config/ subdirectories
8. **Configure development scripts** and build processes

## Security Requirements:
- NEVER include actual API key values in any generated files
- Create clear instructions for manual API key configuration
- Add .env to .gitignore and .cursorignore
- Include environment validation in the application startup

## Success Criteria:
- .env.example exists with all required variables documented
- .env file created with placeholder values and instructions
- Project builds successfully after manual API key configuration
- Environment variables properly loaded in both frontend and backend
- Clear documentation for Lightning Lesson demo setup

IMPORTANT: Focus on environment structure and documentation. Do NOT include actual API keys or secrets.
