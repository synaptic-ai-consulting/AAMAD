# AAMAD MVP System Architecture – Rapid Phase 2 Deployment

## Context & Instructions
Generate a comprehensive system architecture specification for a multi-agent system using CrewAI framework with a modern Next.js frontend and assistant-ui interface. 
This document serves as a detailed blueprint for AI development agents to understand the complete system structure, requirements, and implementation approach for Phase 3 MVP deployment.

## Input Requirements:
**PRD Document**: [PASTE YOUR COMPLETED PRD HERE]
**MVP Scope**: Focus on core value proposition with 80/20 rule - 20% effort for 80% value

## System Architecture Specification - Generate All Sections:

## 1. MVP Architecture Philosophy
- **Fastest Time to Value:** Only enable a simple frontend chat interface for user interaction with CrewAI.
- **Minimal Crew:** Implement just one basic crew instance with 1-2 generalized agents to support the most critical early user use case.
- **Feature Visibility:** Non-essential features (dashboard, analytics, integrations, advanced settings) appear in the UI but remain disabled or display “coming soon.”
- **Zero External Integrations:** No connections to third-party APIs, monitoring systems, or external databases.
- **Cloud-Native Deployability:** Designed to work out-of-the-box in AWS App Runner with minimal configuration.

## 2. Multi-Agent System Specification
- **CrewAI Backend:** Python microservice exposes a single endpoint for chat interaction.
- **Agents:** 1-2 basic agents per MVP crew, defined for demonstration (e.g., "General Assistant" and "Subject Expert").
- **Task Flow:** Sequential agent handling—each user message is processed linearly and returned; no parallel, delegation, or advanced orchestration.
- **Agent Memory:** Stateless—no persistent or shared memory required at MVP stage.
- **Agent Tasks:** Focus only on supporting chat response; all other tools and advanced agent behaviors unimplemented.

## 3. Frontend Architecture Specification
- **Framework:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and assistant-ui for LLM chat interface.
- **UI:** Main chat interface only is functional; secondary features (history, analytics, dashboard, agent management) visible and marked inactive.
- **User Flows:** MVP allows user to send/receive messages in a single session.
- **Accessibility:** Basic ARIA compliance; minimal accessibility and error boundary implementation.

## 4. API and CrewAI Integration
- **API Routes:** Single Next.js route (e.g., `/api/chat`) proxies frontend messages to CrewAI chat endpoint.
- **Streaming:** If supported, allow LLM streaming for chat responses—otherwise, return simple responses.
- **Security:** Basic input validation; no authentication for MVP. No API keys or sensitive data handling required.

## 5. Database & Monitoring Specification
- **Database:** OMITTED—no database in MVP version. No user history or analytics stored.
- **Monitoring:** OMITTED—no metrics, logs, or dashboards implemented.
- **Health:** AWS App Runner health/endpoint status only.

## 6. DevOps Deployment
- **CICD:** GitHub Actions pipeline builds and deploys the Next.js frontend and CrewAI backend to AWS App Runner.
- **AWS Configuration:** Core settings (CPU/memory, port) and container build for AWS App Runner; no persistent storage, secrets, or advanced networking.
- **Rollback:** Manual only.

## 7. Functional Scope Boundaries
| Area                | MVP Functionality             | Future Functionality (UI visible, not active)                |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chat Interface      | Text input/output, LLM crew  | Advanced multi-agent chat, voice/audio, custom tools         |
| Crew Definition     | 1 crew, 1-2 basic agents     | Multiple agent roles, complex orchestration                  |
| Analytics/Dashboard | Disabled                     | User history, analytics, feedback, monitoring                |
| Integrations        | None                         | Slack, email, third-party APIs                               |
| Security            | Basic validation             | Auth, roles, permissions, API keys                           |
| Database            | None                         | User/session history, analytics, agent configuration storage |

## 8. Limitations and Upgrade Path
- Feature upgrades require only backend/service extension and UI component activation—no re-architecture necessary.
- Minimal AWS deployment dependencies allow rapid scaling and future monitoring/database integration once MVP is validated.

## 9. Testing & QA
- Smoke test chat interface and CrewAI response.
- Placeholder UI elements for disabled features checked for correct messaging.
- QA checklist: Responsive chat, correct MVP agent instantiation, AWS App Runner deployment validation.
